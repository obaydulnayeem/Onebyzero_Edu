# Onebyzero Edu

[Onebyzero Edu](https://www.onebyzeroedu.com) is an Ed-Tech platform that facilitates the sharing of academic, skill development, and other resources among students from different universities in Bangladesh.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide a digital platform for every department/class in any institution, organizing educational resources to reduce hassle, and making them universally accessible to all students.

## Operational Since

Our website has been operational since May 2022, and our mobile app development is an ongoing project.

## Focus Area

Currently, Onebyzero Edu activities are focused on undergraduate-level public universities in Bangladesh. We have created features to share resources such as books, previous year questions, lecture slides, handnotes, tutorials, etc., covering all semesters' courses from 1st to 4th year in every department of every university.

## Accomplishments

We have successfully preserved academic resources for the Computer Science and Engineering department at Barishal University. Students are actively using the website, and new resources are continually being added.

## Ongoing Efforts

The process of expanding our platform to cover all other departments at Barishal University is underway. Additionally, we are actively working to extend our services to other educational institutions across Bangladesh.

## Onebyzero Talks

"Onebyzero Talks" is an Ed-Tech talk show and interview program, initiated to counter the overwhelming influence of social media. We aim to provide valuable insights on skill development and careers through conversations with successful students and professionals.
